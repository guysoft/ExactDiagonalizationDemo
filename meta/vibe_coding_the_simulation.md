# Vibe Coding the Simulation

## First Prompt - creating the basis

Hi! can you write me a struct of a many body fermionic basis with every state represented by an integer, and each bit represents a population of a state with angular momentum ranging from m_min to m_max, with a fixed number of particles N, where the total angular momentum is a fixed number M?

## Creating the many body potential hamiltonian

using the Basis struct in basisCreation.jl and a single partical diagonal hamiltonian, write a function that generates the appropriate many body hamiltonian

## Creating the many body interaction hamiltonian

Awesome! can you now write a function that uses the FermionicBasis struct, the 2-particle interaction hamiltonian tensor and generates the many body interaction hamiltonian? Be mindful of the fermionic sign when exchanging particles and make sure you fill the hamiltonian in O(length(basis)), since this is a large sparse matrix. Use the fact that the 2-particle interaction is only non zero when m1+m2=m3+m4

## Testing the fermionic operators

looks really good! Now can you add another file where you test annihilate and create so that I can be sure they do what I think they should?

## Spectrum analysis and visualization

can you add a function that constructs the many body hamiltonian given the parameters mMin,mMax,N,interactionStrength,potentialStrength for every value of total angular momentum M, and plots the low lying spectrum on a united plot as a function of M?

## Setting up the project dependencies

Can you add a Project.toml file with all the packages needed for this project?

didn't you forget arpack?

## Improving the spectrum plot visualization

amazing! now help me make the plot a little nicer: make it a scatter plot instead of a line and make the markers into line shapes

Awesome! now make all the lines the same color, and make the plot size=(1000,1000), and enlarge the fonts even more

## Setting up GitHub repository

Now please help me upload this beautiful project to a github repository?

**Answer:** To upload your project to GitHub, follow these steps:

**1. Stage and commit your changes:**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Vered\Dropbox\00 I'll be the doctor\ExactDiagonalizationDemo"
git add .
git commit -m "Add spectrum analysis, fix numerical bugs, improve visualization"
```

**2. Create a new repository on GitHub:**
- Go to https://github.com/new
- Repository name: `ExactDiagonalizationDemo` (or whatever you prefer)
- Choose Public or Private
- **Don't** initialize with README (you already have files)
- Click "Create repository"

**3. Link your local repo to GitHub and push:**
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username:
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ExactDiagonalizationDemo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

how to undo remote setting

**Answer:** To remove the remote:
```powershell
git remote remove origin
```

To verify it's removed:
```powershell
git remote -v
```

To change the URL instead of removing:
```powershell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEW_REPO_NAME.git
```

## Polishing the Setup Guide

Hi, can you complete this document and make it really pretty and fun to read? Before you rewrite it, can you save a copy of it in its current state to show how awesome the changes you make are? Then, can you add this prompt with the appropriate title to vibe_coding_the_simulation.md?

**What happened:** I had a bare-bones setup guide (`to_do_list_for_coding.md`) with just bullet points and placeholder notes. I asked Claude to:
1. Save the original as `to_do_list_for_coding_ORIGINAL.md` for comparison
2. Transform it into a comprehensive, engaging guide with emojis, step-by-step instructions, links, and personality
3. Document this prompt in the vibe coding log

**Result:** The setup guide went from a skeleton outline to a full-fledged tutorial covering Git, VS Code, Julia, GitHub Student Pack, TeX Live, and essential extensions—complete with installation commands, verification steps, pro tips, and encouragement for impatient students waiting for TeX to install. 🚀

## Refactoring to Standard Julia Package Structure

**Question:** How should I structure this as a standard Julia project?

**Answer:** The recommended structure follows Julia conventions:

1. **Create a module file**: Move all code into `src/ExactDiagonalizationDemo.jl` wrapped in a `module` block
2. **Use `using` instead of `include`**: The main script should use `using ExactDiagonalizationDemo` instead of including files directly
3. **Place run.jl in root**: The runnable script belongs at the top level next to Project.toml
4. **Export key functions**: Use `export` statements to make functions accessible

**Final structure:**
```
ExactDiagonalizationDemo/
├── src/
│   └── ExactDiagonalizationDemo.jl  # All code in a module
├── Project.toml
├── Manifest.toml
├── README.md
└── run.jl                          # Runnable example script
```

This makes the code a reusable library while keeping a simple entry point for users.
