### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mountainMeigui/ExactDiagonalizationDemo.git
cd ExactDiagonalizationDemo
```

2. Activate and install dependencies:
```julia

# with interaction strength 1.0 and confinement strength 0.1
p = compute_spectrum_vs_M(0, 8, 3, 1.0, 0.1, n_states=8)
display(p)

# Save the plot
save_spectrum_plot(6, 31, 6, 1.0, 10^-6, filename="spectrum.png", n_states=100)
```
